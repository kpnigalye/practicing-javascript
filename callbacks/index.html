    <h3>Callbacks in JavaScript</h3>
    <hr />
    <ul>
        <li>
            A callback is a function passed into another function as an argument to be executed later.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you pass a callback function into another function, you just pass the reference of the function.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can also pass an anonymous function as a callback function.
        </li>
        <li>
            The most common example of callback is event handlers. First parameter of the addEventListner function is
            the event name and second param is the reference to the callback function.
        </li>
    </ul>
