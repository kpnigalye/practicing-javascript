    <h3>Demo that shows what is Function Currying</h3>
    <p>This code example covers two ways to achieve it, by using bind function and by using closures. </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Currying is a process in functional programming in which we can transform a function with multiple
                arguments into a sequence of nesting functions. It returns a new function that expects the next argument
                inline.
            </li>
            <li>
                It keeps returning a new function (that expects the argument) until all the arguments are exhausted.
                The arguments are kept "alive"(via closure) and all are used in execution
                when the final function in the currying chain is returned and executed.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h5>For output check your console.</h5>
