    <h3>Demo that shows what is Function Currying</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>This code example covers two ways to achieve it, by using bind function and by using closures. </p>

        <ul>

                Currying and Partial Application are related, but they are of different concepts.
                Partial application transforms a function into another function with smaller arity. Arith refers to
                number of function arguments.
