    <title>JS: Function Currying</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h3>Demo that shows what is Function Currying</h3>
    <p>This code example covers two ways to achieve it, by using bind function and by using closures. </p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Currying and Partial Application are related, but they are of different concepts.
                Partial application transforms a function into another function with smaller arity. Arith refers to
                number of function arguments.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h5>For output check your console.</h5>
